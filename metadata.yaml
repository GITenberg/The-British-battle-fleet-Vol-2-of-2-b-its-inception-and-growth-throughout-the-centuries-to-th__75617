summary: '"The British Battle Fleet, Vol. 2: Its Inception and Growth Throughout the
  Centuries to the Present Day" by Fred T. Jane is a historical account written in
  the early 20th century. This volume serves as a comprehensive continuation of the
  evolution of the British Navy, examining both the technical advancements in naval
  architecture and the shifts in military strategy across different eras. The focus
  of this volume lies on significant battleship classes and innovations, highlighting
  individual ships and their contributions to naval warfare.  The opening of this
  volume begins with an exploration of the "Barnaby Era," detailing the design philosophies
  and battleship innovations led by Sir N. Barnaby in the late 19th century. It discusses
  strategic principles advocating stronger offensive capabilities over defensive measures
  in ship design, leading to a range of battleships like the "Inflexible" that sought
  to blend power with protection. The narrative provides insights into the changing
  nature of naval conflicts while setting the stage for subsequent developments in
  British maritime history. As Jane outlines various classes and specific ships, it
  becomes clear that this work is both a technical examination of these vessels and
  a reflection on their historical significance in the context of British naval supremacy.
